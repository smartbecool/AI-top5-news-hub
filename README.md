## 🌟 Overview

Top 5 News Hub is an interactive, customizable web application that curates the **top 5 trending news items** across categories such as Tech, AI, Sports, EPL, India, USA, and more.

Unlike traditional news feeds, this system uses a **visual bubble interface**, **daily refresh logic**, and **personalized category prioritization** to help users consume news efficiently based on their interests and professional background.

Hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud** and **GitHub**, it serves as both:
- a real working product, and  
- a portfolio-ready demonstration of AI + product-thinking skills.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

People often struggle to:
- find trustworthy top news per category,
- track multiple domains (Tech, AI, Sports, etc.),
- get concise information without reading long news sites,
- and personalize what matters to them.

There is no simple, visually engaging dashboard that shows:
- key updates across categories,
- prioritizes the user’s primary field,
- and refreshes only when needed.

Top 5 News Hub solves this by providing a **daily, personalized, category-controlled, visual news panel**.
